            <p>This theme park is by far my favorite one to go to. I have been numerous times and it never gets old. There are shops, massive roller coasters, water rides. Six Flags Over Georgia is a 290-acre (1.2 km2) theme park located west of Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., in unincorporated Cobb County. Opened in 1967, it is the second park in the Six Flags chain, after the original opening in 1961 in Texas. </p> <p> Six Flags Over Georgia and two of its sister parks, Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags St. Louis, are the only three parks in the Six Flags Theme Parks chain to have been founded by Angus G. Wynne, and thus they are the only parks to have used the "Six Flags" name since their original grand openings. As with the other parks, Six Flags Over Georgia hosts characters from the Warner Bros. animation library, notably the Looney Tunes characters and Justice League from DC Comics.</p>

            <h5>The last time I visited was in 2018</h5> <br>
            
            <p>Not only is it one of the most gorgeously groomed race tracks in the world, but it is also home to one of the largest and most eclectic motorcycle museums in the world. The Barber Motorsports Museum in Birmingham, Alabama receives more than a quarter-million visits per year. This motorsports museum is an awesome spectacle which people claim is reached at after combining a zillionaire with a great passion for restoring and displaying motorcycles. It is a great sight to behold and a must-see destination. It is a leading motorcycle museum in the nation, referred to as the big daddy of motorcycle museums. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, this museum has more motorcycles than any other in the world, both vintage and modern. It has over 1,400 bikes, and new ones arrive.</p><p>As a “time machine” of sights and sounds, HSR provides a venue for competitors and spectators alike to share in the wonderful history and excitement created by the cars that competed at race tracks around the world. It is the goal of HSR to organize and promote competitive races, featuring historic sports-cars.</p>

                <p>Now I must admit I wasn't sure about this one. MULAN seemed to break most of my preconceived rules on Disney movies. These included the fairytale element - a cross-dressing Chinese soldier doesn't have the same magical appeal as, say, the son of the Greek gods searching for his birthright, etc etc. Also, this verge towards realism meant that the bad guy would not be as appealing - Disney villains are camp, over-the-top thespians by rule - Jeremy Irons in THE LION KING for example. I was concerned about the absence of king-of-melody composer Alan Menken, whose wonderful songs encapsulate the charm of Disney.</p><p>However, that said, I thought this film was wonderful. The characters were well thought out and expertly drawn. Not enough songs were present for my liking, but those that were fit perfectly with the story, and the chance to hear the wonderful voice of Lea Salonga (Mulan's songs) is worth the price of this film alone. Eddie Murphy has managed to be as good, if not better, than Robin Williams as the comic sidekick. And the film's conclusion is as genuine and as heartfelt as any adaptation of this story. The mountain scene contains some of the best animation I have seen from Disney, and the rousing score from maestro Jerry Goldsmith accompanies the action superbly.</p>

                <p>When I saw the reviews for this film, I was expecting something very poorly made and bad quality. True, for an adult without a kid it isn't ideal, but why buy a film if it has a cover like this when you're not a child any more? Everywhere online it says this is a great kids flick, for families and more. If you're like me and read reviews before buying or renting a film, then you'd know not to get it.</p>

                <p>Getting to what the movie is like, these aren't the best graphics, but what do you expect in an 1997 film? The Flubber, Weebo etc. are already neatly done, which I find quite impressive for a film made at that time.</p>

                <p>The humor in this may not be the jokes, but not all kids understand certain types of joke, so in the film they just went for the classic 'Bad Guys Whacked In The Face' type. There is no gore or extreme violence in this, everything has a light-hearted touch to it and the flubber truly seems fun to play with.</p>

                <p>Robin does do a good job as the professor, making many wacky inventions and always forgetting. Weebo played by Jodi, continues to be the kind, thoughtful person - or in this case computer - that she is when she plays Ariel in the little mermaid.</p>

Over $350,000 has been contributed to a fund that will help protect gorillas. Now that's how you make money talk!</p>

                <p>Dominated by a handful of huge agri-businesses, the industry is geared around keeping costs low: animals are packed tightly into polluting factory farms, which provide more than 90% of the meat eaten globally. For most of them, it’s a short life of suffering: some are bred to be so large they are constantly in pain, most don’t have access to the outside. To combat disease in overcrowded farms, they are pumped with antibiotics, which contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance. 

The human costs are high, too. Factory farms also pollute the communities they are situated within, disproportionately communities of color, and have a  huge climate footprint. </p>

                        <p class="p_modal">Tanya has worked at her tavern since she was able to see over the bar. She broke up her first fight at 11. By the time she was a teenager she knew everything about the place, and she could run it with her eyes closed. She’d never let anyone—whether it be a drunkard or a captain of the queen’s guard—take advantage of her. But when her guardian dies, she might lose it all: the bar, her home, her purpose in life. So she heads out on a quest to petition the queen to keep the tavern in her name—dodging unscrupulous guards, a band of thieves, and a powerful, enchanted feather that seems drawn to her. Fast-paced, magical, and unapologetically feminist, Wench is epic fantasy like you’ve never seen it before.<br>

                            Snowfall didn't expect to be queen of the IceWings at such a young age, but now that she is, she's going to be the best queen ever. All she has to do is keep her tribe within IceWing territory, where it's safe -- while keeping every other tribe out, where they belong.

It's a perfect and simple plan, backed up by all the IceWing magic Snowfall can find. That is, until a storm of unidentified dragons arrives on her shore, looking for asylum.

The foreigners are completely strange and, Snowfall is certain, utterly untrustworthy. But as she escorts the miserable new tribes out of her kingdom, Snowfall is forced to reconsider her plan. Maybe she can only keep her tribe safe . . . if she's willing to risk everything.<br>

                            The unlikely foursome made up of a geek, a class clown, a teacher's pet, and a slacker -- Brenton, Sam "Snick,", Judy and Kelsey, respectively, -- are bound together by one very big secret: the homework machine. Because the machine, code named Belch, is doing their homework for them, they start spending a lot of time together, attracting a lot of attention. And attention is exactly what you don't want when you are keeping a secret.

                            Before long, members of the D Squad, as they are called at school are getting strange Instant Messages from a shady guy named Milner; their teacher, Miss Rasmussen, is calling private meetings with each of them and giving them pop tests that they are failing; and someone has leaked the possibility of a homework machine to the school newspaper. Just when the D Squad thinks things can't get any more out of control, Belch becomes much more powerful than they ever imagined. Soon the kids are in a race against their own creation, and the loser could end up in jail...or worse!
