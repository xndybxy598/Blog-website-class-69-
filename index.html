            <p>This theme park is by far my favorite one to go to. I have been numerous times and it never gets old. There are shops, massive roller coasters, water rides. Six Flags Over Georgia is a 290-acre (1.2 km2) theme park located west of Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., in unincorporated Cobb County. Opened in 1967, it is the second park in the Six Flags chain, after the original opening in 1961 in Texas. </p> <p> Six Flags Over Georgia and two of its sister parks, Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags St. Louis, are the only three parks in the Six Flags Theme Parks chain to have been founded by Angus G. Wynne, and thus they are the only parks to have used the "Six Flags" name since their original grand openings. As with the other parks, Six Flags Over Georgia hosts characters from the Warner Bros. animation library, notably the Looney Tunes characters and Justice League from DC Comics.</p>

It is a great sight to behold and a must-see destination. It is a leading motorcycle museum in the nation, referred to as the big daddy of motorcycle museums. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, this museum has more motorcycles than any other in the world, both vintage and modern.
